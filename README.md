# Portfolio Optimization and Analysis

This repository contains a project focused on portfolio optimization and financial analysis as the project for Stats 417 (Statistical Models in Finance) of Summer 2024 at UCLA. The project includes portfolio construction, risk assessment, and performance metrics of the portfolio, as well as additional analyses such as debt analysis (credit risk), Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, and interrupted time series analysis related to technology stocks that we have curated from our portfolio.

## Project Overview

The main components of this project are:

1. **Portfolio Construction**:
   - Selection of tech and hedging stocks.
   - Optimization of portfolio weights using Monte Carlo methods.
   - Analysis of portfolio weights and efficient frontier.
   - Calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
   - Performance metrics including Sharpe Ratio and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (H.H.I).

2. **Debt Analysis**:
   - Application of the KMV Merton model to evaluate annual default probabilities for technology companies.

3. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**:
   - Evaluation of stock potential through DCF analysis compared to market capitalization.

4. **Interrupted Time Series**
   - Analysis of stock price changes as an effect of the release of ChatGPT.
