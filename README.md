This repository contains a project focused on portfolio optimization and financial analysis. The project includes portfolio construction, risk assessment, and performance metrics of the portfolio, as well as additional analyses such as debt analysis (credit risk), Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, and interrupted time series analysis related to technology stocks that we have curated from our portfolio.

1. **Portfolio Construction**:
   - Selection of tech and hedging stocks.
   - Optimization of portfolio weights using Monte Carlo methods.
